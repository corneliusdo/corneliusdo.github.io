          <p>I redesigned part of the Car and Home Insurance sales flows to allow customers to opt in for receiving their policy documents by email.

          <p><strong>1. Research</strong><br>To understand the current state, I mapped out the existing sales flows which consisted of 4 variations with additional edge cases. I also analysed current traffic and drop-off rates to ensure I didn't contribute friciton to an already lengthy sales flow.</p>

          <p><strong>2. Understand project constraints</strong><br>I socialised initial designs to tease out architectural and system constraints. That information impacted how I designed. My goal was to create a simple and easy experience that didn't burden customers with unnecessary complexity.</p>

          <p class="row-buffer"><strong>3. Iteration and testing</strong><br>Through rounds of iteration and testing, I was able to refine the design to ensure that customers were able to comprehend how the digital download experience would work. Through this I was also able to refine the interactions in my designs to ensure they made sense to customers.</p>

          <p class="row-buffer"><strong>4. Support scrum team delivery</strong><br>I worked alongside my engineers to tweak designs; making accomodations for technical limitations, legacy design patterns and delivery timelines. The focus was to aid delivery of the changes without compromising the customer experience.</p>

          <p><strong>Archtectural and system constraints</strong><br>The reality of limited project funding, working across different databases and legacy systems meant there were unavoidable constraints. This meant a great deal of time was spent understanding the limitations and going back and forth between my team and the system architect to reach a consensus.</p>
          <img class="img-full-width" src=" " alt="Balancing customer and system diagram">

          <p class="row-buffer"><strong>Translating complexity</strong><br>Due to a number of technical and business reasons, the experience of opting in to receive documents digitally was more complicated than it had to be. Some of the complexity was unavoidable, so I made sure that as litle as possible was experienced by customers. At the end of the day, customers just want the sense of security of an insurance policy and to receive their documents by email. This shouldn't be difficult.</p>
          <img class="img-full-width" src=" " alt="Dealing with complexity diagram">

          <p class="row-buffer"><strong>'Default' nudge design</strong><br>The first question in the experience was designed intentionally, defaulting customers to receiving their documents by email to increase the likelihood of proceeding with that option. This was a direct application of robust findings relating to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect">the Default effect</a>. The email option is a better option for both the customer (it's more reliable and easy to manage) and the business (it costs less than paper documents). Customers are able to opt-out by clicking the secondary link which was also intentionally phrased as "post" instead of "mail" to avoid confusion.</p>

          <p>There were a lot of unavoidable aspects of this project that detracted from an 'ideal experience'. If funded, I would propose the next stage of the project to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Allow customers to change their contact details without having to navigate elsewhere first. Removing this constraint would make the experience truly simple and easy. 👍🏼</li>
            <li>Remove the middle-man third party in the document delivery process so that the experience is shorter and visually consistent. It would reduce any confusion that might be felt by customers who are downloading sensitive documents from a site that is visually inconsistent to the entry point. 👍🏼</li>
