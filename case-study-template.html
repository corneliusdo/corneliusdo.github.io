        <div class="col-lg-9 col-md mx-auto">
          <p>Over 2 days, we were tasked to design and build a crowdsourcing tool for citizens to contribute to early detection, verification, tracking, visualization, and notification of wildfires</p>

          <p>I designed a responsive web experience that provides:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Early detection of wildfires (location and movement)</li>
            <li>A way for users to contribute to fire detection through crowdsourcing</li>
            <li>Simple onboarding for users to start receiving alerts</li>

          <div class="col-lg-9 col-md col-sm mx-auto">
          <p><strong>Users:</strong> Our efforts were focused on high-risk users. These were people living in areas prone to large fires and could find themselves in need of quick evacuation.</p>

          <p><strong>Problem Space:</strong> Bushfires and wildfires are often unpredictable, fast moving and poorly understood. People underestimate how long a fire takes to reach them and once it does, it is difficult to tell which direction it's spreading in. This is life threatening and has lead to people's deaths.</p>

          <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Provide information (movement, direction and intensity) about the fire backed by social proof to enable users to make informed decisions about how to react to the fire.</p>

          <p><strong>Solution</strong> A website that is mobile-first in design is the most effective solution because it provides a low barrier to entry when time is a valuable but scarce resource in reacting to a nearby fire. This decision reflects an inclusive design decision to ensure users living in remote areas could also benefit as fires are more common in non-suburban areas. Notifications would be served using a text delivery service. An stand-alone mobile app would've reduced the effectiveness of the tool.</p>

          <p>Our first priority was to scope out an MVP out of potential features. Features that were deemed necessary to an MVP:</p>

          <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

          <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
