          <p>I redesigned part of the Car and Home Insurance sales flows to allow customers to opt in for receiving their policy documents by email. However, what seemed to be a simple project involved a range of architectural, system and customer problems that needed to be addressed to achieve a seamless customer experience.</p>

          <p><strong>1. Research</strong><br>To understand the current state, I mapped out the existing sales flows which consisted of 4 variations with additional edge cases. I also analysed current traffic and drop-off rates to ensure I didn't contribute friciton to an already lengthy sales flow.</p>

          <p><strong>2. Understand project constraints</strong><br>I socialised initial designs to tease out architectural and system constraints. That information informed how I designed. My goal was to create a simple and easy experience that didn't burden customers with unnecessary complexity.</p>

          <p class="row-buffer"><strong>3. Iteration and testing</strong><br>Through rounds of iteration and testing, I was able to refine the design to ensure that customers were able to comprehend how the digital download experience would work.</p>

          <p class="row-buffer"><strong>4. Visual design and interaction</strong><br>When I reached confidence with the experience design, I refined the visual aesthetics whilst staying true to our patterns. I also introduced subtle interactions to guide customers visually to new or changing information.</p>

          <p><strong>Archtectural and System Constraints</strong><br>The reality of limited project funding, working across different databases and legacy systems meant there were unavoidable constraints. My designs ensured that customers were given the simplest and easiest experience possible without breaking constaints.</p>
          <img class="img-full-width" src=" " alt="Balancing customer and system diagram">

          <p class="row-buffer"><strong>Translating Complexity</strong><br>One of my driving principles throughout the project was to take the system and business requirement complexity and ensure that this was not experienced by customers. At the end of the day, customers just want an insurance policy and to receive their documents by email. This shouldn't be difficult.</p>
          <img class="img-full-width" src=" " alt="Dealing with complexity diagram">

          <p class="row-buffer"><strong>Opt in Design with Cognitive Bias</strong><br>The first question in the experience was phrased intentionally, defaulting customers to receiving their documents by email. Customers are able to opt-out by clicking the secondary link which was also intentionally phrased as "post" instead of "mail" to avoid confusion.</p>
          <img class="img-full-width" src=" " alt="opt in screen">

          <p class="row-buffer"><strong>Process Transparency</strong><br>If customers decide to opt in, there were two possible scenarios:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>They are an existing customer and we have their contact details. Meaning the design needed to confirm the details and communicate expectations.</li>
            <img class="img-full-width" src=" " alt="Confirm details screen">
            <li>Adding visual indicators for users who have seen the fire provides users with an aid in estimating where the fire is and how serious it is</li>
            <li>Adding wind direction allows users to make an informed decision about which direction to flee the fire</li>
          </ul>
          <img class="img-full-width" src=" " alt="Proces screen">

          <p class="row-buffer"><strong>Aesthetic Value</strong><br>To allow users to make informed decisions, the result screens combine satellite data, user reported data and wind direction:
            <ul>
              <li>The NASA API satellite data only provides a rough guide to the fire's location and size</li>
              <li>Adding visual indicators for users who have seen the fire provides users with an aid in estimating where the fire is and how serious it is</li>
